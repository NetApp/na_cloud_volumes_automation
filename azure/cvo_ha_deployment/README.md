# na_terraform_az_cvo_ha
Terraform template to deploy an HA pair Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO) on Microsoft Azure from scratch.

## Terraform Template for Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO) High Availability
This is an archive of Terraform configuration files to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO)   HA pair using Terraform.

These templates use "netapp-cloudmanager" terraform provider.


## Folder Contents
This folder contains various deployment and configuration scenarios for Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO) HA pair deployment.

## Requirements
1. Terraform >= 0.13
2. Cloud Provider Account – Azure
3. Host machine (any OS supported by Terraform)
4. JQ (sudo apt-get install jq or equivalent)
5. Connector created on Cloud Manager through the script should have connectivity to the host from where this terraform script is running.

## Provider documentation
The documentation is available at: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/NetApp/netapp-cloudmanager/latest/docs

### Controlling the provider version
Note that you can also control the provider version. This is controlled by a required_providers block in your Terraform configuration.

The syntax is as follows:

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    netapp-cloudmanager = {
      source = "NetApp/netapp-cloudmanager"
      version = "21.11.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Read more on provider version control.

## Procedure
In order to run the template:
1. Clone the repository.

    ```git clone https://github.com/NetApp/na_cloud_volumes_automation.git```

2. Navigate to the desired folder

    ```cd na_cloud_volumes_automation/cvo_ha_deployment```

3. Login to your Azure CLI (Azure CLI must be installed).

    ```az login```

4. Update the variables in ```terraform.tfvars```.  

5. Initialize the Terraform repository to install all the pre-requisites and prepare for deployment.

    ```terraform init```

6. Verify the terraform files using terraform validate command.

    ```terraform validate```

7. Make a dry run of the configuration to get a preview of all the changes expected by the deployment.

    ```terraform plan```

8. Run the deployment

    ```terraform apply```

To delete the deployment

  ```terraform destroy```
