## Terraform configuration files for deployment of NetApp CVO (Single Node) on GCP
This section contains various Terraform configuration files to deploy/configure NetApp CVO (Cloud Volumes ONTAP) single node on GCP (Google Cloud Platform).

Terraform Documentation: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/NetApp/netapp-cloudmanager/latest/docs

## Procedure
In order to run the template:
1. Clone the repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NetApp/na_cloud_volumes_automation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder
    ```
    cd na_cloud_volumes_automation/gcp/cvo_single_node_deployment
    ```
3. Save the GCP authentication key JSON file in the directory.

4. Update the variable values in ```terraform.tfvars```.
      + You can choose to deploy the connector by setting the variable "gcp_connector_deploy_bool" value to true/false.

5. Initialize the Terraform repository to install all the pre-requisites and prepare for deployment.
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
6. Verify the terraform files using terraform validate command.
    ```
    terraform validate
    ```
7. Make a dry run of the configuration to get a preview of all the changes expected by the deployment.
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```
8. Run the deployment
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

To delete the deployment
    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```
