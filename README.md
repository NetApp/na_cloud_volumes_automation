## Terraform Configuration Files for NetApp Cloud Volumes
This is an archive of Terraform configuration files to deploy NetApp Cloud Volumes on Public Clouds using Terraform.

These configuration files use NetApp cloud manager terraform provider and cloud terraform providers for AWS, Azure and GCP.

## Folder Contents
**AWS:** This folder contains various deployment and configuration scenarios for NetApp Cloud Volumes on AWS.  
**Azure:** This folder contains various deployment and configuration scenarios for NetApp Cloud Volumes on Microsoft Azure.  
**GCP:** This folder contains various deployment and configuration scenarios for NetApp Cloud Volumes on Google Cloud Platform.

## Requirements
1. Terraform >= 0.13
2. Cloud Manager Account
3. Cloud Provider Account – AWS, Azure, GCP
4. Host machine (any OS supported by Terraform)

## Provider documentation
The documentation of Terraform provider for Cloud Manager is available at: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/NetApp/netapp-cloudmanager/latest/docs

The documentation of Terraform provider for AzureRM is available at: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs

The documentation of Terraform provider for NetApp GCP is available at: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/NetApp/netapp-gcp/latest/docs

### Controlling the provider version
Note that you can also control the provider version. This is controlled by a required_providers block in your Terraform configuration.

The syntax is as follows:

- Cloudmanager Terraform Provider
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    netapp-cloudmanager = {
      source = "NetApp/netapp-cloudmanager"
      version = ">= 23.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

- Azure Terraform Provider
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = ">= 3.89.0"
    }
  }
}
```
- NetApp GCP provider
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    netapp-gcp = {
      source = "NetApp/netapp-gcp"
      version = ">= 23.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```
